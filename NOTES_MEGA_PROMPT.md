# ‚úÖ CCMT MEGA MAX MODE PROMPT ‚Äî SmartShelf Notes System (Final)

**Copy-paste this full prompt directly into Cursor Max Mode**

---

## C (Context)
You are building the full professional-grade Notes system for the SmartShelf app. SmartShelf helps users track learning resources (books, courses, podcasts, etc.) and habits, and now includes powerful AI-linked notes. The user wants the final version of the Notes feature, built from scratch in this prompt. It must work perfectly and reflect a polished, futuristic 2025-level product.

This system must be:
- Visually clean and modern with collapsible sidebar
- Functionally smooth with real-time autosave and full mobile responsiveness
- Fully integrated with AI chat per note (not global)
- Deeply aware of linked learning resources, reading progress, and habits

The Notes system should not reuse any old AI Chat code ‚Äî the user previously deleted all general chat components. The new system should be modular and professional, using the new feature-based file structure (/modules/notes, /modules/ai-chat, etc.).

## M (Memory)
Save these decisions for all future Cursor prompts:
- Notes live at `/notes`, `/notes/new`, and `/notes/[noteId]`
- Notes link to learning resources and habits via dropdown
- AI is chat per note, not global
- Tables in Supabase are:
  - `notes` (note data)
  - `note_ai_messages` (chat messages)
- Styling: Clean, modern, minimalist UI with subtle animations and soft cards
- No fake data should ever be used in notes or chat
- All features must work on both desktop and mobile

---

## T (Testing)
Make sure:
- AI messages save and load correctly from `note_ai_messages`
- Linked resource info is visible to the AI
- Notes autosave and rehydrate with no errors
- Chat works even with no linked resource
- Sidebar collapses smoothly and note titles update live
- Inserting AI into note doesn't duplicate or break content
